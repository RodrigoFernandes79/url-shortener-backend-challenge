# URL Shortener Challenge API with Spring Boot, Docker & MongoDB

Welcome to the **URL Shortener API** project! This project showcases a simple URL shortener service built with **Spring Boot**, using **MongoDB** for storage. The application is fully containerized with **Docker** for both the backend API and MongoDB database.

![Spring Boot](https://img.shields.io/badge/Spring%20Boot-3.3.5-green) ![Java 17](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-17-orange) [![Docker Hub Repo](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/fernandesrh/urlshortener-api.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/fernandesrh/urlshortener-api)


## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the application on your local machine. The process is similar for both Linux and Windows environments, but I'll detail them separately for clarity.

### üî• Prerequisites

1. **Docker** - You'll need Docker installed on your machine to run the containers.
2. **Docker Compose** - Used for managing multi-container Docker applications (API + MongoDB).
3. **Git** - To clone the repository from GitHub.
4. **Java JDK 17** - Installed
5.  Have a **Windows / Linux** machine

If you haven't installed Docker yet, follow the [installation guide for Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### ‚úîÔ∏è Cloning the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RodrigoFernandes79/url-shortener-backend-challenge.git
cd url-shortener-backend-challenge
```

---

## üìú Environment Variables

Make sure to set the following environment variables before running the application:

- **MONGODB_USER**: MongoDB username (e.g., `admin`)
- **MONGODB_PASSWORD**: MongoDB password
- **MONGODB_DATABASE**: The name of the database (e.g., `url-shortener-db`)

You can create a `.env` file in the project root to manage these variables.

Example `.env`:

```
MONGODB_USER=your_user
MONGODB_PASSWORD=your_password
MONGODB_DATABASE=url-shortener-db
```

## üê≥ Running the Application with Docker

Once you've cloned the project, follow the steps below to run the application.

### üêß On Linux

1. **Navigate to the project folder**:

```bash
cd path/to/url-shortener-backend-challenge
```
2. **Build the project** with Maven:

```bash
mvn clean package
```
3. **Build the Docker containers**:

Run the following command to build your containers and start the application:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

4. **Access the application**:

Once the containers are up and running, you can access the **URL Shortener API** by visiting:

- To access the API endpoints, go to the URL: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`

### üíª On Windows

1. **Install Docker Desktop for Windows** (if not already installed).

2. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RodrigoFernandes79/url-shortener-backend-challenge.git
cd url-shortener-backend-challenge
```
3. **Build the project** with Maven:

```bash
mvn clean package
```
4. **Build the Docker containers**:

Open **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt** and run the following:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

5. **Access the application**:

Once the containers are running, you can access the **URL Shortener API** at:

- To access the API endpoints, go to the URL: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

- The **MongoDB** container stores the URL data, and the **URL Shortener API** interacts with it.
- The **API** exposes endpoints to create shortened URLs, redirect to original URLs, and view statistics.

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Dockerfile Explained

The Dockerfile used for the **URL Shortener API** container is as follows:

```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim
ARG JAR_FILE=target/*.jar
COPY ${JAR_FILE} app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/app.jar"]
```

This Dockerfile does the following:

- **FROM**: Uses `openjdk:17-jdk-slim` as the base image.
- **COPY**: Copies the JAR file (built by Maven) into the container.
- **ENTRYPOINT**: Defines the command to run the Spring Boot application inside the container.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª API Endpoints

Here are some of the key endpoints of the **URL Shortener API**:

- `POST /api/v1/urls/shorten`: Create a new shortened URL.
- `GET /api/v1/urls/{shortUrl}`: Redirect to the original URL.
- `GET /api/v1/urls/{shortUrl}/statistics`: View statistics for the shortened URL.

---

## üí° Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with MongoDB not starting, ensure that Docker is running correctly.
- If you see errors related to `docker-compose`, try running `docker-compose down` and then `docker-compose up --build` again.
